## 0. Defenses

### Policy language mode

Enumerate PS Language Mode - [#language-mode](basic-enumeration/protection.md#language-mode "mention")

if the Language is constrained:\
try to bypass using PS v2 or [#list-applocker-rules](basic-enumeration/protection.md#list-applocker-rules "mention")

### Bypass AMSI

Bypass AMSI every new PowerShell session -[#amsi-bypass](misc/bypass-defenses.md#amsi-bypass "mention")

Also [#invisi-shell](misc/bypass-defenses.md#invisi-shell "mention") can be used

### Bypass Defender

[#windows-defender](misc/bypass-defenses.md#windows-defender "mention")

### Turn off Firewall

[#firewall](misc/bypass-defenses.md#firewall "mention")

***

## 1. Local Privilege Escalation

check our privileges using `whoami /all`

Use [#powerup-1](privilege-escalation/local-privilege-escalation.md#powerup-1 "mention") and discover the vectors:

* Unquoted Service
* Modifiable Service File
* Modifiable Service

Once we are Local admin use [lsass-dump.md](lateral-movement/lsass-dump.md "mention") to find other users logons

***

## 2. Domain Enumeration

### ACL

[acl.md](ad-enumeration/acl.md "mention")

Better to write down the interesting ACL so they might be useful later

**BloodHound** is very useful visualizing ACLs

### General

[gnereral.md](ad-enumeration/gnereral.md "mention")

Start to build up a mind map for attacking paths

* Domain
* Domain Controller
* Users
* Computers
* Domain and Enterprise Administrators
* OUs
* GPOs
* SPNs

### Forests and Trusts

Understand trusts and map them between the domains

[forests-and-trusts.md](ad-enumeration/forests-and-trusts.md "mention")

***

## 3. Domain Privileges Escalation

### Reverse shell by abusing Jenkins

### User Hunting

[#user-hunting](ad-enumeration/gnereral.md#user-hunting "mention") - Hunt for local admin access

### AD CS

[ad-cs.md](privilege-escalation/cross-domain-privilege-escalation/ad-cs.md "mention")

### Delegations

[delegations.md](privilege-escalation/domain-privilege-escalation/delegations.md "mention") - Search for Delegations

### ACL

[acl.md](persistence/acl.md "mention")

abusing ACL can lead

* [#resource-based-delegation](privilege-escalation/domain-privilege-escalation/delegations.md#resource-based-delegation "mention")
* [dc-sync.md](lateral-movement/dc-sync.md "mention")
* [security-descriptors.md](persistence/security-descriptors.md "mention")
* Reset user password

***

## 4. Lateral Movement

### Bypass Defenses

[#0.-defenses](crtp-methodology.md#0.-defenses "mention")

### OPTH

[lsass-dump.md](lateral-movement/lsass-dump.md "mention") after getting Admin privileges then moving inside the domain using [over-pass-the-hash.md](lateral-movement/over-pass-the-hash.md "mention")then spawn PowerShell session using [winrm.md](lateral-movement/winrm.md "mention").

### User Hunting

[#user-hunting](ad-enumeration/gnereral.md#user-hunting "mention") - Hunt for local admin access

***

## 5. Cross Domain Privilege Escalation

### MSSQL

[mssql-servers.md](privilege-escalation/cross-domain-privilege-escalation/mssql-servers.md "mention")

### Inter-Realm TGT

[trusts.md](privilege-escalation/cross-domain-privilege-escalation/trusts.md "mention") - After abusing Trust keys or krbtgt of trusted domain it is possible to abuse other forest abusing Inter-Realm TGT
